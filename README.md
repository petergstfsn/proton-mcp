Give Claude Desktop (or Cline, or any MCP client) full access to your Proton Mail inbox: read, search, send, draft, triage threads, manage folders, save attachments, and more — 95 MCP tools in total. Most of the same capabilities are also available as a full CLI for scripting, cron, and piped automation — no Claude required.

> **Battle-tested at scale (v2.0.0):** full mailbox backfill validated end-to-end against a real account with 57,000+ indexed messages across 62 folders/labels — including a 22,800-message Archive folder backfilled from scratch, UID-window by UID-window, with zero data loss across restarts, transient IMAP disconnects, and connection timeouts.

## What you get

- **Claude reads and manages your Proton Mail** — triage, reply, draft, archive, search, move, batch-act on threads, pull attachments
- **Full CLI** — a dedicated command for every one of the 95 tools (plus a generic `tool <name>` passthrough), scriptable and pipeable, works in cron and shell scripts
- **Fast local search** — full-text search across your inbox without hitting IMAP on every query
- **Safety controls** — read-only mode, send gate, destructive-action confirmation, per-action allowlist
- **Privacy-native** — no third-party email service involved; your mail stays on your machine

---

## Privacy model

Your emails travel: **Proton Mail → Proton Bridge (local) → this server (local) → your AI client**.

Nothing goes through a third-party email relay. Proton Bridge decrypts your mail locally; this server reads it over a local IMAP connection on `127.0.0.1`. The AI client sees the email content you request. A cloud-backed client can transmit that content to its model provider; local Bridge transport does not make cloud model processing local.

If you use Claude Desktop with the default Anthropic API, conversation content (including email snippets) is sent to Anthropic per their [privacy policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy). If you self-host an LLM or use a local-only Claude setup, nothing leaves your machine at all.

---

## Prerequisites

**1. Proton Bridge** — must be installed, signed in, and running.
Download: [proton.me/mail/bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge)

> **Bridge password vs Proton password:** Proton Bridge generates a separate local password that is *not* your Proton account password. Find it inside the Bridge app under **Account → Copy password** (or similar — exact label varies by Bridge version). You'll need this for setup.

**2. Node.js 20 or later** — `node --version` to check.

**3. Your Bridge credentials** — from the Bridge app:
- IMAP host/port (default: `127.0.0.1:1143`)
- SMTP host/port (default: `127.0.0.1:1025`)
- Username (your Proton email address)
- Bridge password (see note above)

---

## Install

**npm (recommended):**

```bash
npm install -g proton-mail-bridge-client
```

**Homebrew:**

```bash
brew tap googlarz/tap
brew install proton-mail-bridge-client
```

<details>
<summary>Source install (development)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/googlarz/proton-mail-bridge-client.git
cd proton-mail-bridge-client
npm install
npm run build
```

The `proton-mail-bridge-client` binary is available inside the repo after build.

</details>

---

## Connect to Claude Desktop

Run the guided setup wizard:

```bash
proton-mail-bridge-client setup-claude-desktop
```

The wizard:
- checks your local Bridge ports
- asks for your Bridge username and Bridge password
- writes the Claude Desktop MCP config entry

**After setup:** restart Claude Desktop, make sure Proton Bridge is open, then check **`+` → Connectors → proton-mail-bridge**.

### Updating

```bash
npm update -g proton-mail-bridge-client
proton-mail-bridge-client setup-claude-desktop
```

### Manual config

The wizard handles config automatically. If you need to set it up by hand, three credential methods are supported:

<details>
<summary>Option 1 — Environment variables (simplest)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proton-mail-bridge": {
      "command": "proton-mail-bridge-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROTONMAIL_USERNAME": "you@proton.me",
        "PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD": "your-bridge-password",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_SECURE": "false",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_PORT": "1025"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Option 2 — File-based secrets (credentials in files, not config)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proton-mail-bridge": {
      "command": "proton-mail-bridge-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROTONMAIL_USERNAME_FILE": "/path/to/username.txt",
        "PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD_FILE": "/path/to/password.txt",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_SECURE": "false",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_PORT": "1025"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Option 3 — Command-based secrets (pass, gopass, or any secret manager)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proton-mail-bridge": {
      "command": "proton-mail-bridge-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROTONMAIL_USERNAME_COMMAND": "pass proton/username",
        "PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD_COMMAND": "pass proton/password",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_SECURE": "false",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_PORT": "1025"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

---

## Connect to Claude Code

Install globally, then register the server with one command:

```bash
npm install -g proton-mail-bridge-client

claude mcp add proton-mail-bridge \
  -e PROTONMAIL_USERNAME=you@proton.me \
  -e PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD=your-bridge-password \
  -- proton-mail-bridge-mcp
```

`your-bridge-password` is the Bridge app's own password (**Bridge → account → Mailbox details**), not your Proton account password — see the note under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

By default this registers the server for the current project only. Add `-s user` to make it available in every project:

```bash
claude mcp add proton-mail-bridge -s user \
  -e PROTONMAIL_USERNAME=you@proton.me \
  -e PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD=your-bridge-password \
  -- proton-mail-bridge-mcp
```

Verify it's connected:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

For file-based or command-based credentials instead of plaintext env vars, add `-e PROTONMAIL_USERNAME_FILE=/path/to/file` (or `_COMMAND`) the same way — see the credential methods under [Manual config](#connect-to-claude-desktop) above.

---

## Connect to Cline (VS Code)

Install globally (`npm install -g proton-mail-bridge-client`), then open Cline's MCP settings:

- VS Code → Cline extension panel → MCP servers icon → **Edit MCP Settings**
- Or edit directly: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` (macOS)

Add the server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proton-mail-bridge": {
      "command": "proton-mail-bridge-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROTONMAIL_USERNAME": "you@proton.me",
        "PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD": "your-bridge-password",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_SECURE": "false",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_PORT": "1025"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For file-based or command-based credentials, use the same `PROTONMAIL_USERNAME_FILE` / `PROTONMAIL_PASSWORD_COMMAND` pattern from the Claude Desktop manual config above.

Reload the Cline extension after saving. Proton Mail tools will appear in Cline's tool list.

---

## Try it: example Claude prompts

**Morning triage**
> "Give me a digest of my inbox. Flag anything that needs a reply today and anything that looks like a bill or invoice."

**Inbox zero**
> "Go through my unread emails from the past 3 days. Archive newsletters, trash anything promotional, and tell me what's left that needs action."

**Folder filing**
> "Find all emails from stripe.com and move them to Folders/Receipts. Create the folder if it doesn't exist."

**Meeting prep**
> "I have a call with alice@example.com in an hour. Pull up our last 5 email threads and summarise the open items."

**Draft review**
> "Show me my drafts, pick the oldest one, and suggest a better subject line and closing paragraph."

> **Tip:** When creating folders, use `Folders/Name` (not just `Name`) — that's the Proton Bridge namespace for real folders vs. labels.

More recipes — expanded triage prompts, cron scripts for scheduled digests, and a Claude Code `/mail-triage` slash command — are in [examples/](examples/).

---

## Recommended System Prompt

Add this to Claude Desktop's system prompt (Settings → Claude Desktop → System Prompt) for safer defaults:

```
You have access to my Proton Mail inbox via the proton-mail-bridge tool.

Rules:
- Always use dryRun: true before any batch operation (batch_email_action, apply_thread_action).
- Before calling send_email, reply_to_email, or forward_email, summarise what you are about to send and ask me to confirm.
- For anything important or hard to walk back (a wide CC list, a sensitive topic, an attachment), offer a short undo window via send_email's undoWindowSeconds instead of sending immediately — remind me it only protects against mistakes noticed in the next few seconds, not a change of mind days later.
- Before calling delete_email, confirm with me — deletion is permanent.
- Prefer create_draft over send_email when composing from scratch.
- Use get_inbox_digest or get_actionable_threads as your starting point for triage sessions.
```

---

## CLI

Every capability is also a scriptable terminal command — no Claude required:

```bash
proton-mail-bridge-client digest                                    # morning triage summary
proton-mail-bridge-client search --from stripe.com --json | jq .    # scriptable search
echo "Deploy done" | proton-mail-bridge-client send --to you@x.com --subject "Deploy"
proton-mail-bridge-client notify &                                  # background new-mail alerts
```

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output, and any MCP tool is directly callable via `proton-mail-bridge-client tool <name> --args '{...}'`.

**Full command reference: [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md)** (a named command for every one of the 95 tools, across read, triage, compose, mailbox actions, folders, drafts, templates, analytics, and diagnostics).

---

## Safety controls

All flags work in both the MCP server and CLI:

```bash
PROTONMAIL_TOOL_TIER=core            # expose 19 core tools instead of all 95 — saves context window
PROTONMAIL_READ_ONLY=true            # disable all write operations
PROTONMAIL_ALLOW_SEND=false          # disable SMTP sends only (other writes still work)
PROTONMAIL_CONFIRM_DESTRUCTIVE=true  # require confirmed:true on send, reply, forward, delete
PROTONMAIL_ALLOWED_ACTIONS='mark_read,archive,trash'  # per-action allowlist
```

`batch_email_action` and `apply_thread_action` both support `dryRun: true` regardless of the above flags.

## Using it as a library

Beyond the CLI and MCP server, the underlying service classes are importable directly:

```ts
import { SimpleIMAPService, SMTPService } from "proton-mail-bridge-client/services";

const imapService = new SimpleIMAPService(config, logger);
const smtpService = new SMTPService(config);
```

`proton-mail-bridge-client/services` has no side effects on import — unlike the package's
main entry point, which also self-starts the MCP server when run directly. Also exported:
all shared types (`ProtonMailConfig`, `EmailSummary`, `EmailDetail`, …), `planFolderSync`,
`isLikelyAuthenticationError`, and `sanitizeHeader`.

---

## Operational notes

- `get_emails` and `search_emails` return a composite `emailId` — use it for all subsequent reads and actions.
- `search_indexed_emails` supports `from:`, `to:`, `subject:`, `label:`, `domain:` shortcuts.
- The local index lives at `PROTONMAIL_DATA_DIR/mail-index.sqlite`. Background sync and IMAP IDLE keep it warm.
- Audit logs live at `PROTONMAIL_DATA_DIR/audit.log`.
- Draft sync is best-effort — the local draft is always preserved even if remote sync fails.
- System folders (INBOX, Sent, Trash, Spam, Archive, All Mail) are guarded against accidental deletion.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Wrong password" or connection refused**
Make sure you're using the **Bridge password**, not your Proton account password. Find it in the Bridge app under Account → Copy password. Bridge must be running before the MCP server or CLI can connect.

**macOS native module crash after update**
`better-sqlite3` is a native binary built for your machine. After a major Node.js upgrade or environment change, rebuild it:
```bash
proton-mail-bridge-client setup-claude-desktop
```
This reinstalls the runtime and rebuilds native modules in place.

**Claude can't see the connector**
After changing the MCP config, restart Claude Desktop fully (not just reload). Then check **`+` → Connectors → proton-mail-bridge**. If it's not there, run `proton-mail-bridge-client doctor` to validate the connection.

**Folder not found when moving email**
Use `Folders/Name` for real folders (e.g., `Folders/Receipts`), not just `Name`. Labels and folders share the same namespace in Proton Bridge but are structurally different.

### Audit hardening and compatibility

CLI reply/forward honor self-only delivery, confirmation and `--dry-run`. Generic system flags enforce the matching read/star/delete/restore action permission. Labels, folders and custom keywords remain governed by read-only mode, since they are not EmailAction values. Marking a message `\Deleted` also requires destructive confirmation when enabled.

Download destinations must be inside the configured root, with real parent directories owned by the running user and not writable by other users on POSIX. Ancestors must also be owned by the user or system and protected against replacement; trusted sticky temporary directories are supported. Missing download directories are created privately. Symlink destinations are rejected. Explicit saves atomically replace regular files with private files; default attachment saves retain collision suffixes. Windows relies on the selected directory's ACL. Other processes running as the credential owner are outside this isolation boundary.

After SMTP begins, an uncertain failure leaves a source draft non-sendable. Check the Sent mailbox and reconcile delivery before making a new draft. Do not automatically retry an ambiguous delivery. Queued sends still require a running server.

Repeated full syncs perform bounded historical reconciliation after initial backfill; one full call is not a complete rescan. Message parsing is capped at 64 MiB and the message cache at 64 MiB of serialized content as well as 5,000 entries. Thread-reference traversal is iterative. Authentication headers are displayed as unverified observations, not proof of sender identity. Label removal requires an unambiguous exact source match and can refuse messages whose Bridge representation differs between folders.

Legacy IDs cannot prove the original mailbox generation; obtain fresh IDs before mutations. A markerless legacy data directory adopts the configured account, so verify its ownership before upgrading or use a fresh account-specific directory.

This repository retains the upstream npm package name and MCP namespace for compatibility. The checked-in Homebrew formula installs the explicitly pinned upstream archive; it does not contain unpublished fork changes. Install this checkout from source to test this branch. Fork npm publishing is disabled until a separately authorized release configures an owned package and namespace. The unused, unresolvable homebrew-tap gitlink has been removed; the maintained formula is in `homebrew/`.
