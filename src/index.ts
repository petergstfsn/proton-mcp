// content[0].text, again into structuredContent). A single draft with a few-MB attachment already
// roughly doubles in response size; list_drafts sums every draft's attachments into one response with
// no cap, so one large attachment on any draft makes list_drafts exceed the MCP stdio client's read
// buffer on every call — including the very next session's startup listing — permanently bricking the
